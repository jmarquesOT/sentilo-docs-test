Historian Agent
===============

Background on Historian Agent
-----------------------------

As you already might have learned, Sentilo does not persist data forever
because of limited system resources.

Commonly used setup of a Sentilo instance is to employ one of the agents
to copy the data into some external database or storage.

Since the data volumes can be fairly big and the data are mostly
structured (except when the observations are text), it is convenient to
use a scalable solution for time series such as
`OpenTSDB <http://opentsdb.net/>`__.

OpenTSDB installs of top of HBase and HDFS. Exposes a HTTP REST API and
can be used from `Grafana <http://grafana.org/>`__ as one of itâ€™s
datasources.

Configuration
-------------

Historian Agent is configured with a set of .properties files in
sentilo/sentilo-agent-historian/src/main/resources/properties.
